                 <h4>Will I become an entrepreneur after joining NES? Does NES provide opportunities for me to set up a business?</h4>
                 <p>
If you expect to become an entrepreneur or be recognized as one after joining NES, we are sorry to disappoint you. NES has traditionally not incubated any start-ups. However, many of our NES alumni proceed to found their own startups after their years in NES and graduation from NUS. If you are looking at joining a start-up or finding incubation space for your own, you should approach our supporting organisation, NUS Enterprise Incubator (http://nus.edu.sg/nec/vs/incubator/index.html) for more details. So what do we do actually? NES is in fact a resource hub for budding entrepreneurs and people who want to know how to become one. Through our events and programmes, our participants have many networking opportunities with like-minded people, gain start-up knowledge, and learn the business values and pitfalls to avoid through other entrepreneurs' experiences. You will also be acquainted with the resources available to you which are lesser-known to the general student population. For those with brilliant ideas but do not know how to proceed from there, let us know and NES will provide you the resources and avenues to materialize your ideas.</p>

 

 

<h4>How can I be more involved in NES and its entrepreneurial community?</h4>
<p>
If you truly want to be involved on a higher level beyond just participation in our events, NES highly encourages you to be part of our strongly-knitted Main Committee. The NES Main Committee (MACO) numbers at around 140-150 members every year. You will be put through stringent interviews to ascertain your genuine interest and eagerness to learn. You will be leading (Directors and Dept Heads) or working (Executives) in the team which plans, sources for fundings, markets and execute these events and programmes. Besides working with similar passionate and inspired individuals, you get direct access to our resources and contacts, which you need before you jump into starting up your own company. Simply put, NES helps to build the entrepreneurial mindset in you, so you can carry on your pursue towards entrepreneurship. That said, how much you gain from NES is determined from your involvement and initiative. You will only grow (or not) through the effort you put into NES. That is entrepreneurship itself. To conclude, NES is always reinventing itself just like any other organisation. We are trying to extend our reach within and beyond Singapore and are always open to fresh, new concepts that would make NES a sustainable organisation. If YOU have an idea as to where NES should head towards in the coming years, then join the MACO and make that difference!</p>

 

<h4>Can anyone apply to be a MACO member?</h4>
<p>
Any student of NUS pursuing their undergraduate studies is invited to apply to be a MACO member. Another pre-requisite is your true desire to learn and open-mindedness.</p>

 

<h4>How do I become a MACO member?</h4>
<p>
Fill in the application form available on our website and send it to us at application@nes.org.sg by the stipulated date. You will be contacted for an interview ONLY if your application is successful. Requests to review applications will not be entertained. You are still invited to join NES as an ordinary member if you are interested to be a part of this exciting network of people. NES still welcomes your application during the next round of recruitment when you are ready.</p>

 

<h4>Can I join NES but not the MACO?</h4>
<p>
Yes, you will still get invitations to attend all our events and programmes and be entitled to exclusive member privileges. However, no potential housing recommendations can be awarded to you unless you are an active MACO member. Besides, all the fun and learning happens most when you are a part of the MACO :)</p>

 

<h4>How many housing recommendations can NES submit for MACO members?</h4>
<p>
Starting August 2011, under the Residence Admission Scheme(RAS) (http://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/housing/undergraduate/Housing%20Scheme.html), all student groups and societies can recommend 14 students per year. In NES, we are also involved in extra housing opportunities related to NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) House in PGPR. That said, we hope you don't join NES for the recommendation because there is a plethora of opportunities available that will hone you as a person in a way beyond your need for housing. :)</p>

 

<h4>Is StartUp@Singapore(S@S) a part of NES?</h4>
<p>
Yes, S@S is one of the 3 divisions that forms NES. It is in fact NES's flagship project that has gleaned a respectable reputation for itself as Singapore's premier business plan competition. As S@S brands itself as the nation-wide business plan competition, they are lesser known to the public as a NUS students-run organisation.</p>

 

<h4>What can I look forward to as an S@S MACO?</h4>
<p>
S@S organising team numbering at around 60-70, consists of its Lead, Co-Leads and the various department Directors and Executives. You will be part of the team that organises and executes Singapore's largest business plan competition over an intensive 7-month period, during which you can hope to learn much about the whole process of starting up from an insider's point of view. For more information, please check us out at http://www.startup.org.sg.</p>

 

<h4>I am an NES member/MACO member. Can I compete in Start-Up@Singapore?</h4>
<p>
Sure! In fact, we highly encourage you to, as long as you're not an S@S MACO.</p>

 

<h4>Can I contribute to other divisions and departments under NES?</h4>
<p>
Definitely. We are open to interdepartmental mobility and encourage you to get to know more about the other departments as well. Once you've joined us as an NES MACO member, feel free to talk to the other department directors and find out how you can help out with the other departments. More hands are always appreciated, and in turn you can hope to learn more than you had bargained for.</p>

 

<h4>Can I join more than one Global Project?</h4>
<p>
Nope! The level of commitment required for each individual project is just nice to accommodate for the other aspects of your life (i.e social life and studies). Hence, it would be unwise to take on more than one global project. Moreover, there is a possibility that all three teams might be travelling at the same time to various places.</p>

 

<h4>Do I have to foot the bill for my overseas trips?</h4>
<p>
As a member in either one of the three Global Projects, you will be doing the needful to ask for sponsorship and financial aid from various organisations. Traditionally, there is a certain level of subsidy that each global project manages to secure, that is distributed evenly across the project team. That said, NES cannot assure you that any specific amount will be subsidised. With uncertain times ahead and as part of the challenge, it is entirely up to you and your team to devise novel ways to capture potential sponsors :)</p>

 

<h4>What is the Leadership Development Programme about and who can be a part of it?</h4>
<p>
Every year at around March, the outgoing Leaders of NES, S@S and its various constituent projects will name their successors for each project and department. These future leaders will be given the once in a lifetime opportunity to embark on a 2-month Leadership Development Programme. This programme will include various intensive MindJam sessions aimed at honing the leader within, and culminates in a 2-week overseas immersion trip to Silicon Valley (Dream, Dare, Dive) where they will visit the start-ups in the most entrepreneurial community in the world and conquer their inner fears through the highlight activities such as skydiving. This programme is co-organised by the NES and S@S Talent Development Departments.</p>

 

<h4>Does being in NES heighten my chances of going on NOC?</h4>
<p>
NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) is a programme that is NOT affiliated to NES or its members in any way and is an excellent programme for those who are genuinely passionate about entrepreneurship and would like to immerse themselves in that kind of an environment. Passion is what makes many of our members who they are, and as a result, a significant number of them have managed to get through the rigorous selection process to gain entry into the NOC programme out of their OWN merit, accomplishments and contributions to the entrepreneurship community. While NES does give you the opportunity to ascertain your passion in cultivating entrepreneurship, it does NOT guarantee your entry into the NOC programme.</p>
