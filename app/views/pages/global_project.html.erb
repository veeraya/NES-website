              BizAsia started as a bilateral student exchange program organized jointly by the NUS Entrepreneurship Society (NES) and the Peking University Student Leadership Network (PKU-SLN).It has been 6 years since BizAsia entrepreneurial program is launched and we have establish partnership with Peking University, National Taiwan University, Tokyo University, Zhejiang University and Fudan University. With time, BizAsia will strive to be the main meeting point for Asian entrepreneurs and the melting pot for Asian entrepreneurship.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since its inception in 2005, BizAsia has evolved to be not just an exchange, but an exciting platform for young and passionate individuals to come together for a meaningful cause of promoting entrepreneurship beyond geographical boundaries.
            </p>

            <p>
              The exchange programme consisted of 2 parts, the outgoing programme in December to our partner universities in respective countries and incoming programme in January in Singapore. Students embark on a one-week program in the country of each host university. Each host university will organise interactive panel discussions with CEOs of local start-up companies. Following which are visits to successful local enterprises, culminating in networking sessions with local leaders and businessmen. While delegates are being exposed to various business cultures through first-hand experience and interaction with local entrepreneurs in various countries in Asia, they have also sharpened their networking and management skills, and developed everlasting friendship with like-minded peers.
            </p>

            <p>
              This year, BizAsia will be moving towards a multilateral exchange model and aiming to partner with other universities such as University of Hong Kong and Seoul University

              The International Student Alliance for Global Entrepreneurship (ISAGE) was co-founded by the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum (HCEF) and the NUS Entrepreneurship Society (NES). Today, ISAGE provides a key platform for networking and entrepreneurial exchange between NUS and universities in the West.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2008, ISAGE organized the inaugural Harvard – NUS Entrepreneurial Exchange Program (HNEEP), which aimed to provide a good platform for students to share perspectives with top minds about entrepreneurship ecosystems under different cultural, political and economic backgrounds.
            </p>

            <p>
              The exchange program consisted of 2 legs, the outgoing Harvard leg and incoming Singapore leg. In both legs, delegates attended seminars conducted by high-profile speakers such as professors from Harvard Business School and Kennedy school, prestigious entrepreneurs and even the Dean of the NUS Business School. Besides academics, there were also networking sessions as well as company visits to established firms and startups. Moreover, Business Idea Generation sessions held throughout the program allowed delegates to work together, learn from one other and forge lasting friendships for future collaborative studies and entrepreneurial ventures.
